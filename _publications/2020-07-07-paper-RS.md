## Abstract
In this study, an existing combination approach that maximizes temporal correlations is used to combine six passive microwave satellite soil moisture products from 1998 to 2015 to assess its added value in long-term applications. Five of the products used are included in existing merging schemes such as the European Space Agency essential climate variable soil moisture (ECV) program. These include the Special Sensor Microwave Imagers (SSM/I), the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM/TMI), the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) sensor on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Aqua satellite, the WindSAT radiometer, onboard the Coriolis satellite and the soil moisture retrievals from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) sensor onboard the Global Change Observation Mission on Water (GCOM-W). The sixth, the microwave radiometer imager (MWRI) onboard China Fengyun-3B (FY3B) satellite, is absent in the ECV scheme. Here, the normalized soil moisture products are merged based on their availability within the study period. Evaluation of the merged product demonstrated that the correlations and unbiased root mean square differences were improved over the whole period. Compared to ECV, the merged product from this scheme performed better over dense and sparsely vegetated regions. Additionally, the trends in the parent inputs are preserved in the merged data. Further analysis of FY3B contribution to the merging scheme showed that it is as dependable as the widely used AMSR2, as it contributed significantly to the improvements in the merged product.
