## Abstract
Physically based distributed hydrological models are useful for simulating the spatial distribution of hydrologic fluxes across the catchment under various climate and land cover change scenarios. However, complexities associated with their implementation at large scales make their applications limited. Previously, an equivalent cross-section (ECS) based distributed hydrological modelling approach was developed for first order sub-basins to reduce the computational time/effort. Here, the ECS approach is modified for semi-distributed hydrological modelling at the catchment scale. The modelling approach is implemented for a 314?km2 McLaughlin catchment located in south-eastern New South Wales (NSW), Australia that consists of 822 first order sub-basins. A 26?year long streamflow record simulated using an ECS based modelling approach are compared against daily observed streamflow and four calibrated lumped conceptual hydrologic models, and found to be consistent. Further, the simulated actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture from the ECS approach are compared against the Australian Water Availability Project (AWAP) model simulations and results found to be consistent. In addition, the temporal dynamics of simulated soil moisture from the ECS approach is consistent with the satellite derived European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI) surface soil moisture data. In the ECS based semi-distributed modelling, all parameters are derived from the actual topographic and physiographic information of the catchment and none of the parameters is calibrated. Therefore, this approach has the advantage of simulating streamflow in ungauged catchments compared to lumped conceptual models. The impact of spatially distributed climatic forcing and land cover on soil moisture is investigated across four landforms (upslope, midslope, footslope and alluvial-flats) and at various soil depths. Our results show increase of mean soil moisture in shallow layers of upslope toward alluvial-flats. However, mean soil moisture in deeper horizons remained almost constant across all landforms. The variability of daily soil moisture at surface soil layers is higher than the deeper soil layers for all landforms. Our results illustrated that disaggregation of a catchment to a series of ECS at the scale of first order sub-basins, captures dynamics of soil moisture and actual evapotranspiration across the landscape and results are consistent with the climatology, land cover type, topography and soil hydraulic properties. Further, the use of ECS approach in the McLaughlin catchment reduced the number of computational units by 40 times in comparison to 3-d grid based distributed modelling setup.
